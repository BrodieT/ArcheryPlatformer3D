# ArcheryPlatformer3D

This project was created as part of my MProf in Games Development at Abertay.
The project was created in UE4 using C++ by myself, using 3rd party art assets where neccessary.

Due to the size of the project only the source code files have been uploaded here for easy access.
A full breakdown of the project can be found on my portfolio site at:
